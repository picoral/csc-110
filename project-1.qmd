```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
assignments <- read_excel("assessment_schedule.xlsx") %>% 
  mutate(formatted_date = format(due_date, "%A, %B %d, %Y"))
```

Programming Projects are to be submitted to [gradescope]().

**Due date: `r assignments %>% filter(number == 4) %>% pull(formatted_date)` at 7pm**

In this first programming project you will implement a number of Python functions to calculate the area of different geometric shapes. Make sure you follow the provided [style guide](style.html) (you will be graded on it!). You are **not** allowed to use any built-in method or function for any Python library.

Name the program `geometry.py`. Make sure that gradescope gives you the points for passing the test cases.

## Area of a Rectangle

1.  Function name is `rectangle_area`
2.  It takes two arguments: `base` and `height`
3.  It returns the area of the rectangle with given `base` and `height`

$$
area = base \cdot height
$$

## Area of a Triangle

1.  Function name is `triangle_area`
2.  It takes three arguments, one for the length of each side of the triangle: `a`, `b`, `c`
3.  It returns the area of the three given side lengths calculated according to Heron's formula (calculate the semiperimeter first, then use that to calculate the area):

$$
s = (a + b + c) / 2 
$$

$$
area = \sqrt{s \cdot (s-a) \cdot (s-b) \cdot (s-c)}
$$

4.  Do not use any built-in method or function for any Python library. Remember that roots are the opposite of an exponent. So you can calculate the square root of a number by using the exponent form $n^{1/2}$.

## Area of a Trapezoid

1.  Function name is `trapezoid_area`
2.  It takes three arguments: `base_1`, `base_2`, and `height`
3.  It returns the area of the trapezoid with given `base_1`, `base_2`, and `height`.

$$
area = {1/2} \cdot (base_1 + base_2) \cdot height
$$

## Area of a Circle

1.  Function name is `circle_area`
2.  It takes one argument: `radius`
3.  It returns the area of the circle with the given `radius`, rounded at two decimal places
4.  Use the value `3.1415` for $\pi$

$$
area = \pi \cdot radius^2
$$

## Test cases

```{python}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
def main():
    print( rectangle_area(4, 4.5) ) # 18.0
    print( triangle_area(3, 4, 5) ) # 6.0
    print( trapezoid_area(11, 25, 5) ) # 90.0
    print( trapezoid_area(4, 20, 10) ) # 120.0
    print( circle_area(20) ) # 1256.6
    print( circle_area(4) ) # 50.26
  
main()
```
