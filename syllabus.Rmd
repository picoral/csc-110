# Course Format and Teaching Methods

The course will have three required meeting times per-week. The in-class experience will consist of a combination of lecture, programming demonstrations (live coding), and in-class activities. This course will use active learning, peer-teaching, and flipped-classroom teaching techniques.

By active learning, I mean that class time won't be just 50 minutes of me talking. Instead, class meetings will include a number of in-class activities (ICAs) for you to work on individually and/or in a group. Thus, you can spend some time **actively** learning (instead of passively listening to the instructor).

By peer-teaching, I mean that you will have opportunities to learn from your classmates, and vice-versa. In many of the in-class activities, you will be able to work on groups and help each-other when necessary.

By flipped-classroom, I mean that you will often be assigned reading or other material to complete before attending each class meeting time. By doing this, you will come to class with (at least some) preparation. This will hopefully result in more class time allocated towards active learning!

# Absence and Class Participation Policy

Participating in the course and attending the in-person lectures and other course events are vital to the learning process. As such, attendance is required at all lectures.

## Administrative Drops

Every semester, students enroll in introductory CS classes but do not submit any work, resulting in a grade of `E` at the end of the term. To prevent this, at the end of the **second week** (January 19), all students who have not submitted/completed **five or more** of the following will be administratively dropped:

1.  Class presence on January 10
2.  January 10 quiz
3.  Class presence on January 12
4.  [Beginning of semester survey](https://uarizona.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0q8KC0FwVhCiYD4)
5.  January 17 quiz
6.  [Module 1 Programming Problem 1](https://adrianapicoral.com/csc-110/assignments-01.html)
7.  [Module 1 Programming Problem 2](https://adrianapicoral.com/csc-110/assignments-02.html)
8.  Class presence on January 19

In addition, to ensure your success in this course, and that you are on top of the work that is due every week, administrative drops will be in place throughout the semester. Students who miss coursework for two weeks or more often get an E at the end of the term in this course. After the second week of class, at any point during the semester if you fail to attend class and submit assignments for two consecutive weeks you will be administratively dropped.

## Illnesses and Emergencies

-   If you feel sick, or may have been in contact with someone who is infectious, stay home. Except for seeking medical care, avoid contact with others and do not travel.
-   Notify your instructor if you will be missing up to one week of course meetings and/or assignment deadlines.
-   If you must miss the equivalent of more than one week of class and have an emergency, the Dean of Students is the proper office to contact (DOS-deanofstudents\@email.arizona.edu). The Dean of Students considers the following as qualified emergencies: the birth of a child, mental health hospitalization, domestic violence matter, house fire, hospitalization for physical health (concussion/emergency surgery/coma/COVID-19 complications/ICU), death of immediate family, Title IX matters, etc.
-   Please understand that there is no guarantee of an extension when you are absent from class and/or miss a deadline.

# Makeup Policy for Students Who Register Late

If you register after the first class meeting you may make up missed assignments within your first week of attendance. You are responsible for contacting the instructor within that first week to have extensions set-up. The instructor will not be contacting you directly, you have to initiate this process to make up missed work. If you do not, the instructor will assume you are not interested in making up missed assignments.

# Course Communications

All online communication will be conducted through my official UA e-mail address (adrianaps\@arizona.edu) D2L, and Discord.

# Required Texts or Readings

All readings, videos, and assignment instructions will be available in the course website.

-   Course D2L: <https://d2l.arizona.edu/d2l/home/1386086>

# Assignments and Examinations: Schedule/Due Dates

The breakdown of grades in this course is as follows:

-   45% exams
-   25% weekly quizzes
-   5% programming problems
-   10% short programming projects
-   15% programming projects

There will be four exams throughout the course (including the final), for a total of 45%. These exams may cover material from class, the programming assignments, the final project, and the readings. Three exams of these exams will be during the semester, the lowest grade will be dropped (each of the two remaining exam grades is worth 15% of your final grade). If you would like an exam regraded, we reserve the right to regrade the entire exam, not only the parts you might question.

The midterm exams will be on:

-   Midterm Exam 1 - `r schedule %>% filter(exam == "Midterm 1" & term == "spring 2024") %>% pull(formatted_date)`
-   Midterm Exam 2 - `r schedule %>% filter(exam == "Midterm 2" & term == "spring 2024") %>% pull(formatted_date)`
-   Midterm Exam 3 - `r schedule %>% filter(exam == "Midterm 3" & term == "spring 2024") %>% pull(formatted_date)`

You must keep theses dates available. Do not schedule any flights, travel plans, or other conflicts with these exams.

Weekly quizzes will be held every Wednesday (unless otherwise noted). The 2 (two) lowest grades for quizzes will be dropped from final grade calculations.

Short programming projects are due on the same day as programming problems. While the instructions for programming problems are on the website, instructions for short projects will be available only during our weekly 50-minute in-person lab sessions. The lowest grade for short programming projects will be dropped at the end of the semester. There will be two lab sessions (the weeks of March 18 and April 15) for you to work on a maximum of two short programming project submissions you have missed.

To schedule your lab session go to [the weekly lab session spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mS3H-8GyLHb__rZaf9j66khmkncQgeqEXfyVk2l0sNo/edit?usp=sharing).

## Late Work

For programming problems and projects, late work is not accepted

## Extra Credit

Up to 1 point of extra credit will be awarded to students who come to office hours in person. Check our office hours schedule on the website <https://adrianapicoral.com/csc-110/tas.html> and ask the TA or instructor to submit your points to gradescope. 

You are required to ask a question and/or work on an assignment or practice problem with the TA or instructor to receive 0.5 points for each office hour attendance. It is your responsibility to ensure the TA or instructor enter your 0.5 points on gradescope during the session. Instructors will not award you these points at a later date, do not email instructors about getting points at a later date (for example, if you forget to ask the TA to enter your office hour points on gradescope). 

Your first TA office visit should take place before the Midterm 1 date, and the second visit should take place before the Midterm 2 date.

## Final Examination

The final exam is worth 15%.

The final exam will be on:

-   `r schedule %>% filter(exam == "Final Exam" & term == "spring 2024") %>% pull(formatted_date)` -- `r schedule %>% filter(exam == "Final Exam" & term == "spring 2024") %>% pull(time)`  in [CESL 102 and 103](https://maps.app.goo.gl/kBverpH54iz4URAQ6)

You must keep this time available. Do not schedule any flights, travel plans, or other conflicts with these exams.

# Grading Scale and Policies

The instructor and teaching staff will do their best to have grades back to students within 1 week. This includes, but is not limited to, grades for exams, projects, programming assignments, attendance, and quizzes. Once a grade has been entered for a particular item on the digital grade-book, students have at most **5 days to dispute** the grade. This includes disputes related to excuses such as sickness, personal matters, dean's excuses, etc. If 5 days pass and there has not been such a request, the grade is final.

The correspondence between percentage grade and numeric grade is as follows:

-   Greater or equal to 90% at least an A
-   Greater or equal to 80% at least a B
-   Greater or equal to 70% at least a C
-   Greater or equal to 60% at least a D
-   Anything less, at least an E / F


## Incomplete (I) or Withdrawal (W):

Requests for incomplete (I) or withdrawal (W) must be made in accordance with University policies, which are available at <http://catalog.arizona.edu/policy/grades-and-grading-system#incomplete> and <http://catalog.arizona.edu/policy/grades-and-grading-system#Withdrawal> respectively.

# Honors Credit

```{r}
assignments %>% 
  arrange(due_date) %>% 
  select(assessment, formatted_date, due_time) %>% 
  kable(col.names = c("Assessment", "Date", "Time/Location"))
```


# Classroom Behavior Policy

To foster a positive learning environment, students and instructors have a shared responsibility. We want a safe, welcoming, and inclusive environment where all of us feel comfortable with each other and where we can challenge ourselves to succeed. To that end, our focus is on the tasks at hand and not on extraneous activities (e.g., texting, chatting, reading a newspaper, making phone calls, web surfing, etc.).

Students are asked to refrain from disruptive conversations with people sitting around them during lecture. Students observed engaging in disruptive activity will be asked to cease this behavior. Those who continue to disrupt the class will be asked to leave lecture or discussion and may be reported to the Dean of Students.


# Code of Academic Integrity

**All work you submit for grading in this course must be your own. Submitting work that includes many (minor and/or major) components that are not your own work is considered plagiarism. Instances of plagiarism will be reported to the Dean of Students.**

Keep in mind that all assignments and practice problems provided in this course are meant to help you to practice the skills that you will need for graded work (including on paper quizzes and exams), so it is generally in your best interest to avoid taking shortcuts even on these assignments.

Students are expected to adhere to the UA Code of Academic Integrity as described in the UA General Catalog. See <https://deanofstudents.arizona.edu/student-rights-responsibilities/academic-integrity>.

Uploading material from this course to a website other than D2L is strictly prohibited and will be considered a violation of the course policy and a violation of the code of academic integrity. Obtaining material associated with this course (or previous offerings of this course) on a site other than D2L and the course website, such as Chegg, Course Hero, etc. or accessing these sites during a quiz or exam is a violation of the code of academic integrity. Any student determined to have uploaded or accessed material in an unauthorized manner will be reported to the Dean of Students for a Code of Academic Integrity violation, with a recommended sanction of a failing grade in the course (faculty can replace this sanction with whatever sanction they plan to use for their course).

Selling class notes and/or other course materials to other students or to a third party for resale is not permitted without the instructor's express written consent. Violations to this and other course rules are subject to the Code of Academic Integrity and may result in course sanctions. Additionally, students who use D2L or UA e-mail to sell or buy these copyrighted materials are subject to Code of Conduct Violations for misuse of student e-mail addresses.
